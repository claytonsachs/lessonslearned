Retaining software developers

1.  Invest in their personal growth- support their pursuit of new languages and learning
2.  Hold 1 on 1 meetings with them, mostly at their request, as a developmental tool
3.  Give them a sense of ownership in their work
4.  Allow for flexible working hours
5.  Give them a comfortable place to work with optimal feng shui
6.  Don't forget the perks (free food, energy drinks, laundry, etc)! 
7.  Competitive compensation is a prereq but at the end of the day you must show them that you are also invested in their work!
