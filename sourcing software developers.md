Below, I have described a number of ways that 'business-people' can try to source software developers to work on their projects.

- Ask other developers (this is probably the best approach); they will hopefully have an understanding of who is involved in the developer community, presents at meetups, etc.
- Post on a mailing list (possibly one distributed through certain meetups)
- Look at the credits of good websites / software (this is a less common approach nowadays, as credits aren't common to see)
- Use services that provide access to freelancers (upwork, rent a coder, elance, guru, etc.)
- Go to universities and ask members of relevant clubs or post on jobs/message board at computer science school
- Go to meetups for the relevant technology; if taking this approach, be careful not to come across as a 'vulture' who is just looking for engineers; dress casually and ask people if they know others who might be interesting in working on a type of project (for $), rather than asking them to work for you
